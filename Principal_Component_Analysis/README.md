1. Open the Rstudio IDE or any other R IDE to run the R file.
2. You Can retrieve the Image from the following public URL: http://all4desktop.com/data_images/original/4186002-feathers-in-colors.jpg
3. Pre-install the libraries like tidyverse needed for running the R file.
4. Open the R file in th Rstudio and run in the Assignment2.R or Linear_Regression.rmd file available.
5. The correlation of each predictors and the output parameter in the dataset is analysed using the corrplot.
6. The output plots and the output data will be displayed in the plots and console pane respectively for different models of the linear regression with different predictors.
7. Many multi linear regression models have been developed from different predictors and based on the F-statistics, Residual standard error, Multiple R-Squared , Adjusted R-Squared and significant codes, best model with a suitable predictors are identified.
8. Forward selection, Backward elimination and both forward & backward selection methods based of AIC is used to identify the best p-vlaue, Standard error and f-statistics of a best model.
